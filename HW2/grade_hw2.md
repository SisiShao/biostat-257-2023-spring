### Overall Grade: 82/95

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

Yes

-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

Yes

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (ipybn or qmd) for reproducibility?

Yes

-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

Yes

### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 37/45

- Q1.3 (NNMF correctness) (5/10)

For each r in {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the final objective values and number of iterations should roughly match those by Dr. Zhou. Your algorithm is converging after only two iterations! (-5)

- Q1.3 (NNMF efficiency) (18/20)

Number and amount of memory allocations should roughly match those by Dr. Zhou. (-2)

- Q1.4 (non-uniqueness) (4/5)

Explanation should mention non-convexity of the objective function. (-1)

- Q1.5 (Fixed point) (5/5)

- Q1.6 (Interpretation of NNMF) (5/5)

- Q1.7 (GPU, optional) (20 bonus points)

N/A
	    
### Usage of Git: 8/10

- Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 

Not enough commits. You should be commiting your work consistently while working on your homework to have a history of the changes that you have made! (-2)
          
- Is the hw submission tagged? 

Yes, but not under a name like "hw2"

- Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly?

Yes
  
- Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. 

Yes

### Reproducibility: 7/10

- Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? 

No. Need to have submitted the .txt files as well. (-3)

- If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

N/A

### Julia code style: 20/20

1 point for each violation. Multiple violations of the same rule accumulates until hitting the maximum of 20 points.

- Rule (1). Four space indenting rule. 

- Rule (2). 92 charcter rule.

- Rule (3). Space after comma rule.

- Rule (4). No space before comma rule.

- Rule (5). Space around binary operator rule.
